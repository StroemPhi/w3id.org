ChemDCAT-AP
========

This is an extension of the DCAT Application Profile PLUS LinkML schema that is used by NFDI4Chem & NFDI4Cat to provide chemistry and catalysis specific metadata for a dataset.
Its serves as a core that can further be extended in profiles/schemas to provide even more chemistry specific metadata for a dataset within a specific use case, e.g. NMR spectroscopy.
